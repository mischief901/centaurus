# Centaurus

This is a work in progress.

The Centaurus library adds the functionality to create Quic connections to the
BEAM via Nifs interfacing with the Quinn library written in Rust.

## Installation

Install the git package from github. Elixir 1.10 and Erlang OTP 22 are needed as
well as Rust 1.39+ and Cargo.
